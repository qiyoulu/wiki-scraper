Flea allergy dermatitis

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of flea allergy dermatitis is complicated by the grooming habits of pets. Cats in particular are very efficient at grooming out fleas, often removing any evidence of infestation. Fleas begin biting within 5 minutes of finding a host, and there are no flea treatments that kill fleas before biting occurs.

Treatment
The aim of treatment is to relieve the allergy-induced itch and to remove the fleas from the pet and its home environment. In some cases, secondary bacterial or yeast infections will also need treatment before the itching subsides. The administration of oral or topical flea prevention is also required to kill fleas currently on the animal.
Environmental flea control includes using flea foggers or bombs, vacuuming, and treating pet bedding by washing on a hot cycle (over 60 degrees Celsius) in the washing machine.
Many pets with flea allergy dermatitis may also have other allergies, such as allergies to food, contact allergies, and atopic dermatitis.
