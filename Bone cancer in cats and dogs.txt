Bone cancer in cats and dogs

Signs and symptoms
Dogs with limb osteosarcoma typically show lameness and swelling at the affected site. For other sites, dogs may show difficulty to open their mouth (if jaw bone cancer), nasal discharge (if nasal cavity bone cancer) or neurological signs (if spine bone cancer).

Diagnosis
The initial evaluation involves radiographs (X-rays) of the affected site, but the only way to confirm the diagnosis is by sampling the tissue via biopsy or needle aspiration.

Treatment
Depending on the pet's unique condition, there are several treatment options, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Treating the pain adequately is also of crucial importance to improve the pet's quality of life, especially if amputation is not performed.
