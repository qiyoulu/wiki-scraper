Congenital portosystemic shunt

Treatment
Spontaneous closure of CPSS can ocur in some anatomic forms during the first two year of life. However, in instances where spontaneous closure does not occur, radiologic or surgical closure of the CPSS is recommended to prevent, resolve and/or stabilise complications.
Upon discovery of a CPSS in a child, it is important to rule out portal hypertension or hepatic hemangioma as the cause of the shunt, either of which would require a specific treatment. Once the congenital, and isolated, nature of the shunt has been ascertained, closure by surgical intervention is usually recommended. Shunt closure prevents the development of complications in pre-symptomatic subjects and may reverse or stabilize signs and symptoms in patients.
