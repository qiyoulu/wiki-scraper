Feline cutaneous asthenia

Symptoms
In the case of the autosomal dominant form of the disease, kittens are often born with abnormally soft and velvety skin.  Normal scratching and playing with other cats will begin to cause tears in the skin, usually starting at around eight weeks of age.  Injuries often heal rapidly, leaving scars.  Rarely, joint overmobility can result from the disease.
Autosomal recessive cats can develop extreme skin hyperextensibility, but do not suffer from joint hypermobility.

Treatment
Although feline cutaneous asthenia is not curable, there are treatment and management options for the disease.  Affected animals must be kept away from others, and sharp corners on tables and other furniture must be padded.  Cats should have their claws regularly trimmed so that they cannot injure themselves while scratching, and it is often advised that males be neutered, both because of the heritability of the disease and because there is a chance of injury during mating.  If something causes the skin to tear, it should be sutured if possible, and the wound should be treated with antibiotics as needed.  Vitamin C is also given to cats in controlled doses, to assist with the translation of collagen.  Given proper care, cats with feline cutaneous asthenia can live long lives, although the prognosis is not as positive if joint hypermobility is present.
