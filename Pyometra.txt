Pyometra

Signs and symptoms
The most obvious symptom of open pyometra is a discharge of pus from the vulva in a female that has recently been in heat.  However, symptoms of closed pyometra are less obvious.  Symptoms of both types include vomiting, loss of appetite, depression, and increased drinking and urinating.  Fever is seen in less than a third of female dogs with pyometra.  Closed pyometra is a more serious condition than open pyometra not only because there is no outlet for the infection, but also because a diagnosis of closed pyometra can easily be missed due to its insidious nature.  Bloodwork may show dehydration and/or increased white blood cell count. X-rays will show an enlarged uterus, and ultrasound will confirm the presence of a fluid filled uterus.

Treatment
The most important aspect of treatment of pyometra is quick action to provide supportive care.  Female dogs are often septic and in shock (see septic shock). Intravenous fluids and antibiotics should be given immediately. Once the female dog has been stabilized, then the treatment of choice is an emergency spay. In livestock the treatment of choice for minor cases is dinoprost tremethamine (lutalyse). Supportive antibiotic treatment may be recommended also. Severe cases require surgery.
