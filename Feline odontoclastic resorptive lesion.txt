Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion

Clinical signs
Clinical signs of TRs are often minimal since the discomfort can be minor. However, there may be subtle signs of discomfort while chewing, as well as anorexia, dehydration, weight loss, and tooth fracture. The lower third premolar is the most commonly affected tooth.

Treatment
Treatment for TRs is limited to tooth extraction because the lesion is progressive.  Amputation of the tooth crown without root removal has also been advocated in cases demonstrated on a radiograph to be type 2 resorption without associated periodontal or endodontic disease because the roots are being replaced by bone.  However, X-rays are recommended prior to this treatment to document root resorption and lack of the periodontal ligament.
Tooth restoration is not recommended because resorption of the tooth will continue underneath the restoration. Use of alendronate has been studied to decrease progression of existing lesions.

Differential diagnosis: dental caries
True dental caries are uncommon among companion animals. Although it has not been accurately documented in cats, the incidence of caries in dogs has been estimated at 5%. The term feline cavities is commonly used to refer to TRs; however, saccharolytic acid-producing bacteria are not involved in this condition.
