Feline acne

Treatment
Topical treatments such as warm compresses to the chin area may be sufficient for mild cases. Veterinary intervention may be required for treatment if secondary infection occurs.  In this case, treatment may begin with clinical drainage of the pustules and a course of oral antibiotics.
Clearing the acne can be accomplished using an extra-soft bristled toothbrush or flea comb (one designated for this purpose) to brush the cat's chin. This will loosen debris and remove dried scabs. Epsom-salt compresses applied twice daily dry the affected area to relieve the inflammation and itchiness.
