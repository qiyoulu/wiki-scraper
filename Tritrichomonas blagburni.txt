Tritrichomonas blagburni

Treatment
Complete eradication of the parasite continues to be sought. However, antiprotozoal agents, such as ronidazole or metronidazole, are known to dramatically reduce symptoms in cats. Research has found that cats left untreated will have 88% of their symptoms cease after two years.
